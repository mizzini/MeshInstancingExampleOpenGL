Small project code adapted from Computer Graphics Programming (Gordon; Clevenger). 

This example uses `glDrawArraysInstanced` to render 100k meshes simultaneously, and applies some transformation to them. I added some simple keyboard interactivity, and the ability to switch between cube and pyramid meshes to better understand VAOs, VBOs, and vertex data management.
